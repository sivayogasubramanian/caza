## Overview

University students have a lot on their plate, and for those who aspire to break into software engineering, the internship season can be quite the headache. Caza reduces their burden by helping students track their internship applications.

Caza is an internship or job application tracker for Computer Science (CS) students. It allows users to track the progress of the applications, note down tasks, and access global statistics of application statuses for various job roles.
